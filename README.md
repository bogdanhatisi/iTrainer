# iTrainer 🏋️
<ul>
<li>iTrainer is an AI-powered app that helps you perform exercises correctly.</li>
<li>It was developed during the 3 days of the Cluj Hackathon, by Truta Dan (https://github.com/trutadan) and myself</li>.

<h1>Overview</h1>
<ul>
<li>🍏 Exercise is a must for one's health, but to get all the benefits it must be performed correctly.</li>
<li>✔️ That is where our solution, iTrainer helps you exercise, giving you real-time advice on your execution. It was developed using an already trained model (PoseNet) and calculating different angles using detected joints(knee, hip, ankle).</li>
<li>👨‍💻 We could only implement the Squat in the given 3 days, but the goal of the app is to cover a wider range of exercises</li>
<li>🎤 If you are interested in our pitch deck, you can check it out here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B1vARr5nPZNzSCuHy5uaaAbg2QdQVpu1edQiKDECvGo/edit?usp=sharing</li>

<h1>Squat Demo</h1>
📝 Here we can see two squat executions, one correct and one wrong. iTrainer gives us tips based on the mistakes we've made:

<h2>✔️ Correct squat: </h2>

<h2>❌ Wrong squat: </h2>

<h1>Future development</h1>
🚀 As seen in the GUI, we are planning to implement exercise recommendations along with more supported exercises.
